## Graphics Programming Project 2015

**Due: 5pm Friday, November 13th 2015**

You have just started working for a games company called GaCo, and as your first task you have been asked to create a small addictive 2D game using HTML5 and JavaScript.
The game will, for the time being, be focused only on players accessing the game through their desktop browser.
GaCo hopes the game will become popular, so that they can then sell advertisements on the webpage where the game is available.


>*The beauty of Pac-Man is that anyone who plays it immediately knows what is going on in the game. That is why it still works today if you download it on a smartphone. Thirty-five years ago, we were limited by the power of the CPU, now we don’t have those constraints, but game makers need to be thinking about what made the older games so good.*
